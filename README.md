# vk.find-friends

My project is actually a desktop application that allows you to find friends that are near you.

This idea is inspired by the “find friends” option in the Facebook but instead of the Facebook, this
application uses your vk.com account. If you do not familiare with this social network you can easily
find more information about it in google.

This app is no more than for the study purposes and it is based only on two vk.com api methods:
- users.Get;
- users.getNearby.

This app will login in to your vk.com profile and will send requests to the vk server to find some people near you.
For more information you can ckeck "https://new.vk.com/dev/" page.

If you have any notes and suggestions about my code I will be pleased if you tell me about it.
